# Launch Sequence Checklist
Don protective gear (glasses, safety helmet, overall, safety boots).  
Propellant casting.  
Igniter preparation.  
Launch brief including safety procedures.  
Review of flight systems (recovery system, telemetry and avionics, propulsion).  
Launch site selection and preparation.  
Complete vehicle airframe inspection (Ensure the rocket and recovery system are properly installed. Check that all rocket parts are aligned and secured.)  
Load SRM into the rocket. (Insert engine and igniters. Note: One of the most common reasons a rocket will not launch is because the igniters are not pushed all the way into the engine. When launched, the spark does not reach the engine fuel, and nothing happens.)  
Load avionics and telemetry systems.  
Complete launch pad inspection.  
Slide the launch rod through the launch lug on the rocket.  
Attach alligator clips from the batteries to the igniter wires. Make sure they don’t touch each other.  
Activate avionics.  
Ensure spectators are at least 30 meters away.  
Clear launch pad of all non-essential things/personnel.  
No low flying aircraft overhead.  
Wind conditions are favorable (wind speeds no greater than 20 km per hour)
